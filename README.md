# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Task

Build a cimple calendar application using jQuery and Moment.

## Result

The calendar was built on the premise that you have a set schedule day to day. It shows in green events you have coming up, in red the current event happening, and in gray things that happened in the past. Military time was utilized for my personal preference.
